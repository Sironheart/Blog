# sironheart.dev

This is the repository to my private site [sironheart.dev](https://sironheart.dev).

It uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to generate a static site. All styling is done with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), Code highlighting comes from the amazing [torchlight.dev](https://torchlight.dev).

To develop locally just run `npm install` and `npm run start`.

Thanks to Tim Kleyersburg for allowing the usage of his setup for this blog. Take a look at his page over at [www.tim-kleyersburg.de](https://www.tim-kleyersburg.de/)
